#### Install Postman
(Optional) [Download and install Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

------------------------------

## Application Setup

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to this project's production directory called "ArtGallery".
3. Within the production directory "ArtGallery", create two new files: `appsettings.json` and `appsettings.Development.json`.
4. Within `appsettings.json`, put in the following code. Make sure to replace the `uid` and `pwd` values in the MySQL database connection string with your own username and password for MySQL.

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database={YOUR_DATABASE};uid={USERNAME};pwd={PASSWORD};"
  }
}
```

5. Within `appsettings.Development.json`, add the following code:

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Trace",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Information",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  }
}
```

6. Open your shell (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) to the production directory "ArtGallery", and run `dotnet ef database update`.
    > To optionally create a migration, run the command `dotnet ef migrations add MigrationName` where `MigrationName` is your custom name for the migration in UpperCamelCase. 
7. Within the production directory "ArtGallery", run `dotnet watch run --launch-profile "ArtGallery-Production"` in the command line to start the project in production mode with a watcher. 
8. To optionally further build out this project in development mode, start the project with `dotnet watch run` in the production directory "ArtGallery".
9. Use your program of choice to make API calls. In your API calls, use the domain _http://localhost:5000_. Keep reading to learn about all of the available endpoints.

------------------------------

## üõ∞Ô∏è API Documentation
Explore the API endpoints in Postman or a browser.

### Using Swagger Documentation 
To explore Art Gallery with NSwag, launch the project using `dotnet run` with the Terminal or Powershell, and input the following URL into your browser: `http://localhost:5000/swagger`

## Generating a JSON Web Token
In order to be authorized to use the `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` functionality of the API, you are required to authenticate yourself through Postman with a JSON Web Token (JWT).

------------------------------

> ### Registration
In Postman, create a `POST` request using the following URL `http://localhost:5000/accounts/register`

Add the following query to the request as raw data in the Body tab:
```json
{
  "email": "email@test.com",
  "userName": "testUser",
  "password": "Test123!"
}
```

*If you would like to customize your password, please ensure that your password has: *1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter, 1 number, 1 special character, and is at least 6 characters long*.

> ### Expected JSON Response
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "User has been successfully created"
}
```

Add the following query to the request as raw data in the Body tab:
```json
{
  "email": "email@test.com",
  "password": "Test123!"
}
```
> ### Expected JSON Response
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "email@test.com signed in",
  "token": "{yourGeneratedToken}"
}
```

<html>
<img src="ArtGallery/wwwroot/img/Postman2.jpg">

------------------------------

> ### Using the JSON Web Token

* Copy `{yourGeneratedToken}` from the response Body 
* Click on the 'Authorization' tab 
* Adjacent to 'Type' will be a drowndown menu, click on the menu and select 'Bearer Token'
* Within the Body, paste `{yourGeneratedToken}` in the empty form field adjacent to 'Token'

    > You now have full access to the Art Gallery. 

Test it out by sending a `GET` request to the following endpoint `localhost:5000/api/artworks/{id}`

### Available Endpoints

`GET` http://localhost:5000/api/artworks/

`GET` http://localhost:5000/api/artworks/{id}

`POST`http://localhost:5000/api/artworks/

`PUT` http://localhost:5000/api/artworks/{id}

`DELETE` http://localhost:5000/api/artworks/{id}

**Note**: `{id}` is a variable and it should be replaced with the id number of the artwork you want to `GET`, `PUT`, or `DELETE`.

------------------------------

#### Optional Query String Parameters for `GET` Request

| Parameter   | Type        |  Required    | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | -----------  | ----------- |

```
http://localhost:5000/api/artworks?page={customize}&pageSize={customize}
```
